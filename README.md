Udacity DAND Project6 Data Visualization

## Summary

## Design
Char type: modified bar chart

Visual encoding:
- x axis: survived
- y axis: age/sex/pclass/etc.
- color: survived (double encoding)

Use one dot for each person, with some animation/interacition

## Feedback
1. 
> too many empty space.
> separating the areas of male and female and making them closer will be nice I think 
2. 
> you need to place some numbers otherwise, the reader will have to count the dots.
3.
> similar colors of buttons and circles lead to misunderstanding
4.
> axis should have meaningful labels
